# Machine Learning Projects
Projects from CSUF Machine Learning course.

Analysis of datasets using machine learning concepts in a Jupiter Notebook file.

## Project 1 - Outlier Analysis
This project contains 8 experiments where we analyze a given student attendance data file. This file contains student names along with the minutes they attended class for the first 5 weeks. Experiments 1 - 3 focus on reading the data into Python and then finding summary statistics, such as mean, median, and quartiles. Experiments 4 - 7 explore how we can use Tukey's Fences and standard deviations to find outliers in the data set. Experiment 8 compares our results using both methods and highlights the differences between these methods.
